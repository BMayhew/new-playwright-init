# Playwright Init Base

This repo was built using the [npm init command](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#using-init-command).

The only modifications were commenting out the different browser runs, adding an test/api directory and creating an api test example.

See .github/workflows/playwright.yml to see how to cache playwright dependencies in github actions.
